This is an Xposed module to optimize the Android Media Scanner. The code is not up-to-date for current Android versions.

I have decided to share this since I do not have any time to maintain this code unfortunately.

This requires [an additional library](https://github.com/thomasmhofmann/com.thomashofmann.xposed.lib) to build.
